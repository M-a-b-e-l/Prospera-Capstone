## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Our pod had three main successes this week: Helping eachother when needed, keeping up with our sprint deadlines and incorporating previously given feedback. Throughout the process of our sexond sprint, I would say we were not only very proactive to help eachother with our tasks', but also we were also very willing to help eachother on features of our web application when needed. 
We managed to adhere to our sprint deadlines, showcasing our commitment to timely delivery and efficient workflow management. We also successfully integrated feedback from previous reviews, (for example, we received feedback about extra security for users so we took that feedback and implemented hashing both passwords and security answers) which helped us improve the quality and functionality of our web application.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 A lot of the challenges faced during this sprint was mostly due to the frontend of the application and implementing many state trackers to monitor statuses such as when a user is logged in, if they contain a userId, etc. Another example of a problem we were dealing with was in concern to the widgets feature on our dashboard. We wanted to implement a dynamic system which continuously monitored the sizing and placement of the widgets, thus we came up with an end-to-end solution that encapsulated not only the placement but also the contents of the widget themselves.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We did get to finish all of our tasks in our sprint plan as expected. In concern to our next steps for sprint 3, we will just have to refine our curremt core features especially when it comes to the dashboard and chatbot. For example, our current implementation of the chatbot creates a new conversationId each time the chatbot receives a prompt, so we will be tweaking it such that a user is able to continue a conversation.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Honestly, our fellow peers were one of our biggest resources when it came to developing the MVP. Not only were our peers able to explain concepts in new and innovstive ways, but also we were able to struggle through similar problems we had with our codes. In terms of online sources, the documentation for API's such as Novu, YH finance, etc were used heavily alongside AI.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

One user story that may be at risk is the personalized insights from the chatbot as we left that user story in particular for the refinement process during sprint 3. But this feature shouldn't be at risk of being cut off entirely.
