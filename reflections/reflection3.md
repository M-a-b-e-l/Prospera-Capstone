## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week our team was succeeded in implementing a fully customizable dashboard that allows users to input and keep track of their financial information such as bank accounts, running totals, stock portfolio, and news articles of interest. As a team we were able to come together and fully collaborate on this feature which is the most significant feature of our application Prospera. Thanks to everyone's hard work and dedication, the final website came together beautifully.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 This week, our team faced some challenges related to unexpected bugs throughout our website including the implementation of some of the features in our deployed version. Additionally, one of the hurdles that we had to overcome was not only implementing some of our mentor's feedback but doing so in the short timr that we had left. As a team, we took some time to carefully plan out the features that were left to implement while keeping in mind which ones had the highest priority. Doing so allowed up to have a fully functional website at the end. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were indeed able to finish all of the expected tasks in our sprint plan for this week. For our next sprint, we will focus on the rest of the product backlog which is mostly to implement general styling modifications. Overall, we had a pretty productive week in terms of completing all of our set tasks. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources provided were instrumental in our progress for this week. Our instructors and peers played a big role in the development progress for our MVP 2.0. We are extremely grateful for our instructors' and mentors' patience when explaining complex topics and their dedication to helping us solve our blockers. Additionally, we relied on many online guides, documentations, AI, and other tutorials to fill in knowleges gaps whenever it was useful or necessary. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature that has been at risk and as a team we decided to not move forward with was the "participating in gamified financial challenges" given that it was a strecth feature which we ultimately did not get the chance to implement in our site. If given more time, this is one user story that we would have surely implemented. Overall, as a team we decided to prioritize quality over quantity and we are satisfied with the finished product.
