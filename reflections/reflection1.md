## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Honestly, our team had quite a few successful things happen this week. For example, the frontend for our login and registration is successfully connected to the backend, so all user info is visible in our database. Another great thing we accomplished was testing our API endpoints for our chatbot, which proved successful. Finally, we are really happy about the design of our landing page, and we like the fact that clicking the About or Contact nav button will navigate a user to that particular seciton of the landing page.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges faces within our pod included an unexpected issue with the NewsAPI and creating the dashboard. In regard to the NewsAPI, we realized that the free version of the API did not allow for us to access full news article content, so we were unable to display a complete news article within our website; while this is disappointing, we are still conducting research to potentially find an free/not too expensive news API that will allow us to get all content of a news article. In the meantime, our website simply redirects a user to the article's original URL. In terms of the dashboard, it was definitely a challenging task, since it was something none of us had experience with; a lot of outside research was conducted to find the best approach for creating the dashboard. Ultimately, this proved successfuly as we were able to find a React package called react-grid-layout to create a dashboard with draggable and resizeable widgets. Although we are not finished with the dashboard, we were all glad we completed the basic functionality of the widgets.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Overall, I would say that we finished all of our tasks in our sprint plan for this week. There were a few things that are not completely finished, like the forgot password page, but these pending items are either almost complete or simply need to be connected to our backend. We're really happy with our progress thus far, and we can't wait to begin spring #2, where we will finish up our MVP.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources provided to us by our instructors were very helpful in allowing for us to complete our tasks for this sprint. For example, the video resources about user authentication and OpenAI chatbot implementation really guided our team in completing our login/registration and chatbot features. There were some tasks that required more support from our instructors, such as creating the dashboard, but these features were pretty specific, so we weren't expecting to have reviewed them in class; and, of course, our instructors were all more than willing to help us out with debugging and developing ideas on how to approach certain hurdles we faced. Shout out to all of the instructors, especially our team mentor Erika!

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We haven't really identified any user stories/features that are "at risk"; we have almost completed all the features that we deem the most important, so no truly important features shoudl remain unfinished, which is what we're really hoping for. It may be possible that some of our stretch features may not be completed, but that is okay because we have identified them as nice to have, but not necessary for what our project is trying to achieve.
