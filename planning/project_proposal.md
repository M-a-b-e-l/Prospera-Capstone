## Related Work

- Similar apps/websites: **Pinterest, Reddit, Tinder**
- Our project will stand out by offering a Tinder-like swipe feature that shows one restaurant at a time, allowing users to swipe right or left based on their preferences and saving liked restaurants to a personal bank. This swipe-based matching system, combined with comprehensive filtering options and personalized recommendations, ensures users find exactly what they want with minimal effort. We will also integrate a Reddit-inspired review system to highlight authentic and helpful reviews (possibly by adding credibility through verification measures). Seamless reservation integration enables users to check real-time availability and book tables directly. With a visually engaging, Pinterest-like interface and intuitive navigation, users will enjoy an enhanced exploration experience. For restaurant owners, our platform provides efficient reservation management, making it a unified, efficient, and reliable solution for both users and businesses.


## Open Questions

**General Questions**
- How can we effectively manage the scope of our project to avoid having to cut down features towards the end of development?
- Questions about an effective and unique title. Should we use “Sizzle” and risk it being similar to Tinder? Or should we opt in for a more unique term such as “MenuMingle”?

**Structural/Technical Questions** 
- Although this project idea seems to pair better with a mobile application, how can we adapt it so that it fits well with a web application instead?
- How can we effectively integrate an API into this application?
    * For restaurant database
    * Table booking
    * How do you develop/approach a social API that is continuously updating?
